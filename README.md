# web-based-audio-player
As my personal interest in listening music I utilize my programming knowledge to enhance my skills by creating web based audio player.

Web based audio player not only play tracks from playlist but also allow user to add song to the playlist without interrupting on going music. The information of added song will stored into database which prevent user to lose their data upon closing browser window. User can comes able to play previously added song at anytime ensuring that localhost server is up and running.
